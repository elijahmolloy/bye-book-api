## Patterns
- Entities will not contain any validation other than required/unique/etc. All validation should be completed on the DTOs that are passed from controllers -> Services.
- If there is a module that contains a service/entity, only that module's service will be allowed to interact with that mongoose schema. Services and controllers can interact with other services from other modules. 
- Entities should always be converted to a DTO by the controllers before being returned.
